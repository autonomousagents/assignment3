(M) 2.1
Apply independent Q-learning and analyze what happens for 1,
2, 3 and 4 predators. Note that the prey learns also. Illustrate the
performance of this algorithm for different parameter settings,
with informative graphs.


variable 1: episodes
variable 2: alpha
variable 3: gamma
variable 4: cases (1 pred, 2 pred, .. etc.)

===>(?)	find best value for alpha
	x-axis: episodes
	y-axis: cases
	z-axis: alpha
	fixed gamma

===>(?)	find best value for gamma
	x-axis: episodes
	y-axis: cases
	z-axis: gamma
	fixed alpha

===>	x-axis: episodes
	y-axis: cases
	z-axis: catch probability
	fixed alpha & fixed gamma (the best found)

===>	x-axis: episodes
	y-axis: cases
	fixed alpha & fixed gamma (the best found)
	nr of steps until caught & nr of steps until clash
